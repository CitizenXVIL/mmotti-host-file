# MMottiâ€™s wildcard host-file

A wildcard enabled host-file for use with Samsung Knox Firewall. Based on Dan Pollock's host-file (someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts)

```

```

### Blacklist recommendations
These domains are annoyances that cannot be included in the main host-file due to issues that may arise as a result of blocking them.
* graph.facebook.com (Facebook Ad Choices; can break Facebook login etc.)

### Whitelist recommendations
These domains may need to be whitelisted for certain sites to function correctly.
* analytics.twitter.com (reports of broken twitter links)
